[!] Requirements:
- Python 3
- Read and write permissions in running directory

[!] Note:
- Two extra files have been used to reduce code repetition, these being "encoding.py"
and "Reencoding.py". Encoding.py is used to read in a DFA and rencoding.py is 
used to output the DFA in the same format with which it was inputted.

- Make sure that the text file from which the DFA is being inputted has no 
blank space at the end of each line, otherwise an error will be encountered.
e.g. instead of "a b ", make it "a b".
